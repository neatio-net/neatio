# Neatio Client

## Building the client from source:

To build Neatio client from source you will need to install **Go** (Golang) and a **C** compiler.


**Note:** At least `v1.16` of **Go** is required for building the client.


You can download and install **Go** from the official guide from the [Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

After all the dependencies are installed and the $PATH is set, open a terminal and run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/neatlab/neatio.git && cd neatio && make neatio
```
That's it!
